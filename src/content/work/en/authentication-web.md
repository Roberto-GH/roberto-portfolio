Authentication Web: A Comprehensive User Authentication System

Authentication Web is a comprehensive user authentication system that utilizes a combination of robust technologies to provide secure and scalable user management capabilities. It leverages the power of Spring Boot, Spring Security, Angular, and AWS to deliver an efficient and maintainable solution.

JSON Web Token (JWT)-Based Authentication: Authentication Web utilizes JWT, a widely adopted standard for secure authentication. JWT provides a compact and self-contained method for transmitting user identity and authorization information between the server and the client.

Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture: The front-end is built using Angular, embracing the SPA architecture. This modern approach provides a seamless user experience, enabling dynamic page updates without reloading the entire page.

Deployment and Infrastructure

Backend Deployment: The backend is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, a fully managed service that automates deployment, scaling, and monitoring. This ensures high availability and simplifies infrastructure management.

Front-end Hosting: The front-end is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket, a durable and scalable object storage service. This provides a cost-effective and reliable solution for serving static front-end assets.

Code Availability

The source code for both the API and front-end is readily available on GitHub:
