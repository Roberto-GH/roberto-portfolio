Web Chat: A Comprehensive ChatGPT API with a User-Friendly Interface

Web Chat is a comprehensive solution that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with ChatGPT's powerful capabilities. It offers a secure and scalable API that abstracts away the complexities of ChatGPT, making it easier for developers to integrate its functionality into their applications.

Secure and Scalable API: The API is built using Spring Boot and Spring Security, ensuring secure access and authentication. It provides a well-defined interface for interacting with ChatGPT's various features, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate it into their applications.

Responsive Web Chat Interface: The front-end is developed using Svelte, a lightweight JavaScript framework. It provides a user-friendly chat interface that mimics the conventional chat experience. Additionally, the responsive design ensures optimal viewing and interaction across various devices.

Code Availability

The source code for both the API and front-end is readily available on GitHub:
