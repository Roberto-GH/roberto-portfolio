Telefónica del Perú has implemented a specialized portal that enables customers to register their complaints, ensuring compliance with the regulations established by the Supervisory Body for Private Investment in Telecommunications (OSIPTEL).

Customer Complaint Registration Portal: The portal provides a user-friendly interface for customers to register their complaints, streamlining the process and facilitating communication with Telefónica del Perú.

Spring Boot Backend-for-Frontend: A Spring Boot backend-for-frontend architecture was implemented to centralize and simplify the consumption of services required for complaint registration functionality. This REST API approach enhances the usability and maintainability of the application.

Spring Cloud Config Server: A Spring Cloud Config Server was implemented to centralize application configurations, adhering to Telefónica's development guidelines. This centralized approach facilitates consistent and manageable configuration management.
