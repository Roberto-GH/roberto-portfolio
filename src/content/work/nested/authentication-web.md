Authentication Web is a login page created with tools like Spring Boot and Spring Security allowing me to authenticate, authorize and manage users and roles. This using the JSON Web Token (JWT) standard that defines a compact and autonomous way to transmit information securely between parties as a JSON object. In addition, including a refresh token method allowing to maintain the user's session in the browser safely, regardless of the use of cookies.

As for the user interface, I used Angular as front-end technology, allowing me to adopt one of the most used architectures in recent years, Single Page Applications (SPAs). As for the styles part, use Bootstrap that brings a set of front-end tools, thus achieving fast, efficient and scalable development.
